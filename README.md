# Hypothesis Testing: Does a college degree affect peopleâ€™s income? 

Hypothesis testing concept on the impact of education (degree level) on income.

I used a basic central tendency measurement (mean, median, mode) and spread measurement (variance, standard deviation, range, quartile)

The data used in this analysis is [marketing_campaign.csv](https://github.com/roberdmanihuruk/education_income_hypothesis_testing/blob/main/marketing_campaign.csv)



## Result of hypothesis testing

The analysis used anova testing, and the p value > 0.05 which indicates the college degree (education level) affects people's income
